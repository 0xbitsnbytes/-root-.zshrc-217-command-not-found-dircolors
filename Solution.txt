 We need to Goto etc/enivronment and edit the file .
 nano /etc/environment isn't going to work. 
 
Type  this in root terminal:
 /bin/sudo nano /etc/environment
root@kali:/home/rishi# /bin/sudo nano /etc/environment

    ******You will get Some thing like this:*******
# START KALI-DEFAULTS CONFIG
# Everything from here and until STOP KALI-DEFAULTS CONFIG
# was installed by the kali-defaults package, and it will
# be removed if ever the kali-defaults package is removed.
# If you want to disable a line, please do NOT remove it,
# as it would be added back when kali-defaults is upgraded.
# Instead, comment the line out, and your change will be
# preserved across upgrades.
